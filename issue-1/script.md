### Arco Issue 1

#### We're Here to Talk About Blame (draft 2.0)

###### By David Waugh

Page 1 - Interior - Operating Theatre
======

\*Scene is between JEX and RM-HOBB-1200. JEXA is an athletic, sweet
looking girl sitting in a futuristic doctor's procedure-room (Black
dominates the pallet of the room. Tron-like?). HOBB is a
program/robo-surgeon about to perform open-cranium surgery. Google
pictures of existing telerobotic surgery galleries to get an idea of
what it might look like, but I'm thinking bigger and with a comfortable,
raised bench for her to sit on during the conversation like in GP
offices. I see HOBB having a blood red center-eye from which multiple
industrial-style robotic arms extend radially.\*

### 1st: Over the shoulder Jexa to Hobb

> Jexa:

> The last time I was here, when did you put me under anesthetic? I mean, when during the procedure.

> XRM1200:

> How much do you remember, Jexa?

### 2nd: Jexa and Hobb in profile 

> Jexa:

> Fragments. Pieces of this room. Or maybe it was one similar. You look different.

> HOBBx1200:

> Upgrades...

### 3rd: Jexa in close

> Jexa:

> I think I remember a conversation similar to this, or maybe that was the previous cycle. Don't you think it's odd, Hobb, that I never think about it until right before? I'm only ever in your wing for the conversion procedures. When I do try and think about it, things become hazy. Like looking at the event through stacks of sheet-glass.

> Hobb:

> Memory can be a funny thing.

======

### 1st:

> Hobb:

> Surely your legal team has exposed you to the agreed-upon risk-spectrum and side-effects of today's procedure. The neural scarring and gap-memories both pre and post-operation. I am made to understand that you signed the contract of your own free will, and are not under duress.

### 2nd:

> Jexa:

> I am not under duress, Hobb. What did we talk about last time, before you got started?

> Hobb:

> I have stored the stim-feed from all of our patient consultations, as well as all bedside repartee if you wish to re-experience your actions in detail.

### 3rd:

> Jexa:

> Pass.

/*JEX BEAT - Look at floor (emote)/*

Page 3 - Interior - Operating Theatre
======

### 1st:

> Hobb:
>
> The answer to your first question is that the initial aesthetic is applied only to the narrowest of memory groupings on the chopping block, and spreads from there organically. You have already been administered this. Going through your project notes, you'll find even the broad strokes of your character and the pre-production process are becoming...slippery.

> Jex:

> Hmm. This is feeling familiar. But did we go somewhere last time?

### 2nd:

> Hobb:

> We went out on the wire, off of the central grids. While your drug-regime kicked in. \*beat\*

> It takes about 30 minutes, so we sat on a null/null and watched the burn.

### 3rd:

> Jex:

> Was that your suggestion or mine?

> Hobb:

> Yours actually. My wish is that you will make the same request today. I have prepared a new avatar, as was your request during our last encounter. I expect you shall find it sufficiently "less scary" than my previous effort. Nevertheless, my analysis of your interests-profile leads me to believe that there is something you will wish to be shown...

Page 4 - Cyberspace - Sitting on a ledge
======

> Jex:

> What is that?

> Hobb:

> A beacon.

Page 5 - Cyberspace - Sitting on a ledge
======

### 1st: Over-the-shoulders, we see down to a lighthouse built in cyberspace

> Jex:

> It's beautiful. Where did it come from?

> Hobb:

> It was created by an explorer, of sorts. A boy, really. 16 years old. Now he's doing hard time after being tried as an adult. Those in your age-cohort call the activity Bombing Void. He was picked up three layers down from his entry point into the Arcology's Shell.

### 2nd/3rd:

> Jex:
>
> Stealing around inside our walls and skies.

> Hobb:

> Exactly.

Page 6 - Cyberspace - Sitting on a ledge
======

### 1st:

> Jex:

> Why is the fact that he travelled 3 layers significant?

> Hobb:

> It's the furthest anybody has ever gotten without being caught or killed, or both.

### 2rd:

> Jex:

> Did he create the lighthouse, himself. The design?

> Hobb:

> Unknown.

> Jex:

> Is it permanent?

> Hobb:

> Unknown. I believe it has been hard-wired into the backbone of the grid.

### 3rd:

> Jex:

> And now he's rotting in a cell. I suppose his purpose was also unknown?
>
> Hobb:

> No. In my opinion, his purpose was clear...

Page 7 - Interior - Operating Theatre
======

### 1st: Jex falls asleep in on the shoulder of (or in the lap of) Hobb

> Hob:

> To be the first.

> Jex:

> ZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz

### Overlay:

\*Close-up on HOBB'S avatar's face.\*

### 2nd: Switch to real-world. Jex is laid out in an hyper-advanced operating theatre. 


\*Hobb is fully extended over her, beginning his operation.\*

### Overlay:

\*Close on Hobb's mechanical eye, to parallel top of page.\*

### 3rd: 3 panels. 

1.  Bonesaw starting up, with "Bzunggggggggggggggg" sound. Armatures in
    midground and background. Part of Jex's head visible.

2.  Bonesaw making contact with the skin, as white sealant is applied
    with another arm.

3.  Switch to the grid. Close up of beacon/lighthouse.

Page 8 - Interior - Prison Interview Room
======

### 1st: King sits in the office of a Psychologist (Doc) at a Juvenile Detention Facility on L2 Prison

\*Doc is portly, good humored, at easy, and sitting in a chair across
from King, who is also comfortably seated for his interview/session.\*

> Info Box:

> 5 YEARS EARLIER.

> Doc:

> I don't understand why you're being so difficult. This isn't the first time we've spoken, Isaac. When you were younger, I couldn't shut you up.

> Isaac (KING):

> The terms of my incarceration where clear. I'm to be released, as of today.

> Doc:

> Pending summary interview. That's my job.

### 2nd:

> Isaac:

> Look, I don't have anything to add to our previous conversations, Doc. My understanding is that you have to follow the procedure, which means I'm out of here in the next few hours.

> Doc:

> Correct.

> Isaac:

> Not to be a dick, but that means you don't have a lot of power over me one way or another right now.

### 3rd:

\*cut to King leaving the prison, either in one frame, or in multiple.
The dialogue is overlaid in a "NARRATOR" Box.\*

> Doc (Narration):

> Also Correct.

Page 9 - Exterior - Prison Layer
======

### 1st: King walking to L2 Prison train platform

\*King waits at the train platform inside the enormous, engineered gorge
that surrounds the prison structure. The prison itself is about half as
high as an average New York skyscraper, and looks like a highly bevelled
torus. The gorge separates the prison itself from a sparsely settled
layer with a small feeder community and Icelandic-style geography (no
trees, varied terrain, and black volcanic scars carved into the land).
At least a 3rd of the layer is gorge, and it goes deep, at least 3 times
as high as the highest layer. 3 times the height of the Empire State
Building. It also extends up in great walls all the way to the ceiling,
leaving the prison torus partially covered by the facade of the stone
walls. The prison complex extends deep into the walls\*

\*King is dressed in a prison-orange jumpsuit, with a white t-shirt
underneath. The jumpsuit has been stripped off to the waist.\*

\*The Prison will be revisited in later issues\*

### 1st and 2nd: establishment shot (birds eye?)


> Doc (through narration):

> But since I have you here, let's look at your file, Isaac.

### 3rd Panel 1:

> Doc (narration):
>
> I've only been working with you for 3 years.

\*shot of King approaching the platform where a small crowd is gathered,
waiting for trains\*

### 3rd Panel 2:

> Doc (narration):
>
> But I have Dr. Angler's notes. All your sessions are recorded, as you know. I understand that you are resentful of your childhood therapist's recordings being included as part of your case-file.

> Doc (narration):

> You became troubled at a young age. What would you have us do?

\*shot of three 14 year olds eyeing King from a distance\*

### 3rd Panel 3:

> Doc (narration):

> This is the prison system after all.

\*the teens hand King two shopping bags full of clothes\*

Page 10 - Exterior - Train Platform
======

### 1st Panel 1:

\*King changing clothes\*

### 1st Panel 2:

\*Boarding the train\*

> Doc (narration):

> First time I met you, you'd been sautÃ©ed like a porterhouse. Your cortex had been cracked by some polymorphic security layer deep in XY's network topology.

### 1st Panel 3:

\*The teens pass around a streamlined version of Google Glasses. They
have 1 pair between them\*

### 2nd Panel 1:

> Doc (narration):

> One of the cowboys you were contracted under shorted, too. He said you went by Quasar.

\*The teens pass around a streamlined version of Google Glasses. They
have 1 pair between them\*

### 2nd Panel 2:

> Doc (narration):

> He had no idea you were 13 at the time.

> Doc (narration):

> According to your case notes, they called you Kali Clutch before that. And Copper.

\*Train leaves the station\*

### 3rd Panel 1:

> Doc (narration):

> After we started our sessions together, it was Welcome. Then, The Watchtower.

\*The next teen takes his turn looking at King through the Glasses\*

### 3rd Panel 2

> Doc (narration):

> Law Enforcement picked you up last year in a sting op, along with a dozen other runners. They all knew you as Cobalt, or Kid. You'd amassed quite a reputation for yourself.

\*Train goes up ramp up to next layer, disappearing into the wall\*

### 3rd Panel 3

> Doc (narration):

> So my question is this: what are they calling you now, Isaac?

\*The next teen looks at King, huge grin on his face\*

Page 11 - Interior/Geospace - Train

### All - King sits on the train, with tag projected above his head.

\*King sits stretched out in a mostly empty train car. His head is
tipped back so you can't see his face clearly, both arms are up on
either side of the seat-backs, in a relaxed position (see character desc
for image). Above him, the digital tag "KING" is overlaid in geospace,
and little augments decorate the car interior.\*

### 1st: Panel 1 - King gets off the train at a rural station (see layer 12)

> Infobox:

> Layer 12 - Delta

> Doc (Narration):

> So you're nobody? Well, I didn't think I'd get an answer. Look Isaac, I can see you got smart. No more screeds and speeches, you just stonewall and wait it out.

### 1st: Panel 2 - King walks alone on the side of a quiet country road

> Doc (Narration):

But you go right back to it. Bee-line straight to the tribe, right Isaac? Before I went straight, the community congregated in the warehouses of Avenue City, up on 22.

> Doc (Narration):

> We would job off of a stolen Daikaiju line, using old Voca jumpcores that were still the size of a wallet.

### 1st: Panel 3 - King approaches a futuristic manor

> Doc (Narration):

> But I know time tears at the relevance of the things that we did and the people we knew. It's all different now, isn't it Isaac?

### 2nd: King is greeted at the balcony area by 30 hackers at sunset . This shot focuses on their faces.

> Doc (Narration):

> Or is it basically the same.

### 3rd: Panel 1 - Dance Floor 

> Doc (Narration):
>
> We once cracked 22's EVE skypane system for a weekend so we could stall the sunrise until after we passed out. Cyclodexadrine lasts for 36 hours, and we had hundreds of patches. It was the 40's.

### 3rd: Panel 2 - Hacker's Office, Boer sits behind his desk. King sits, relaxed, in is company.

> Doc (Narration):

> That's when I met Jacobos Boer. I know you know him. We've talked about his influence on you before.

### 3rd: Panel 3 - King gets temple implants at a retail-like chop-shop

> Doc (Narration):
>
> More important than anything though, is once you're out, you get your wires back.

Page 13 - Int/Cyber/Ext - Hackers
======

### 1st - Hacker Girls see Layer 11 refs

> Doc (Narration):

> And the girls...

### 2nd - King falling through cyberspace

\*King is deploying fractal algorithms to disassemble parts of encrypted
security layers as they rise up. King controls himself with a partial
glide, due to some feature of his avatar.\*

> Doc (Narration):

> But before long, you start working on your twitch. Practice rounds for the next run into Arco's Shell.

### 3rd - King approaches entrance to shell (see ARC PP layer 12 for ref)

\*The green pasture leads to a cliff with a waterfall, and a castle
turret protecting a cave.\*

> Doc (Narration):

> Boer took me a few times.

> Doc (Narration):

> I never went alone.

Page 14 - Interior - Entering the Shell
======

### 1st - Panel 1: Cave chamber with Shell door exposed

> Doc (Narration):

> Where are you crossing over these days, Isaac? All the upper-layer approaches have been blocked.

\*King's slumped body lies next to a solid metal door, inset deep in a
passage of the limestone cave. Wires run from the inside of King's shirt
to the doorframe, where they are attached to exposed leads.\*

### 1st - Panel 2: King falls through cyberspace, hacking the door


> Doc (Narration):

> You've found another way.

### 1st - Panel 3: Gantry, in shadow.

> Doc (Narration):

> I know what draws you to it, Isaac. Right when you cut behind the first tier of security: the absolute isolation.

\*King creeps out onto a shell gantry.\*

### 2nd: View of King overlooking auto-highway with various bots.

> Doc (Narration):

> You can sense that it's some place you're not supposed to be.

> Doc (Narration, bottom of panel):

> And the place senses you, too.

### 3rd: 1st panel - Siren pops out of wall panel and produces red light against murky darkness

> Doc (Narration):

> I've felt the adrenaline rush when you pop your first siren panel.

> Doc (Narration):

> So you find a hardnode and hope the backdoors haven't been patched over.

\*King alerted is illuminated by the red light of the alarm.

### 3rd: panel 2 - Robotic eyes and perhaps silhouettes materialize in the dark.

> Doc (Narration):

> We used to run from everything but the framer bots, until another of Boer's protÃ©gÃ©s fried an Intermediate using polyrhythmic compression.

\*The sets of eyes menace from the darkness. King does not need to be
shown\*

### 3rd: panel 3 - King wedged in a crevice, slumped

> Doc (Narration):

> For a few months, we had wide latitude to explore. We went *far*. When the system adapted, a party of 6 got pinned down by a DX-4423.

> Doc (Narration):

> All killed.

\* King is wedged in a crevice, passed out, wires running from under his
shirt to a hardnode. Robots pass outside the crevice.\*

Page 15 - Interior - Shell
======

### 1st - Bodies 

\*two facedown skeletons partially decayed into the floor fill the frame.
King is in the foreground. The darkness lies beyond. Note on skeletons:
the decay process is unique in the shell, as the system categorizes the
body as organic detritus that does not affect operations, therefore it
is left undisturbed until a cleaning cycle runs (every 25 days), and the
tiny cleaner bots (fingernail-size) tear and drill at the flesh. The
environment is otherwise highly anarobic, so for the purposes of
artistic expression, the only decay on the body is mechanical. Bodies
decay completely in 100 years. These ones are perhaps 70 years old.\*

> Doc (Narration):

> Just a few of many eaten up by that place.

> Doc (Narration):

> "Things that you've seen; things that you've made peace with." That used to be your response, as rote as it was. Dr. Angler had video of you saying it. I have the same. Synaptic strength tells us how strong the sentence jumps to mind, as if memorized at a young age.

> Doc (Narration):

> Who taught you to say that, Isaac?

### 2nd/3rd - Rappels and Squeezes

\*King descends down tight, sharp chasms of metal and slate concrete,
sometimes using a rappel rope and rig he stores in his backpack. At the
end of the page, King is squeezing himself along a crushingly tight
passage, pushing his backpack in front of him. See Google Image Search
of Cavers in a 'squeeze'.\*

> Issac (Narration):

> Kid can't have a mantra? I taught myself. We've been over this, Doc. You're recycling stories. We had a deal. I would come to these sessions willingly. I would choose to talk, or I would choose not to. You would not repeat yourself.

> Doc (Narration):

> So he *can* speak.

> Issac (Narration):

> Not today.

> Doc (Narration):

> Right, and that's your choice. But they pay me to talk, Isaac. More than you'd think, actually.

> Doc (Narration):

> You and your compatriots have been ***commoditized***, and they apply those in my role as can-openers to get at the ***goods***.

> Doc (Narration):

> How many private-sector interviews have I set up for you? You could have walked out of here anytime, but none of those paths led back to the Shell.

> Doc (Narration):

> I'm supposed to use my capacity as your psychologist to ask you questions that prompt reflection and self-awareness.

> Doc (Narration):

> So here's my question, Issac: What's the point? The farther you go, the tighter the passages get, until you're done. You can go no further.

> Doc (Narration):

> And you turn back. There's nothing out there.

> Doc (Narration):

> I've seen it before, when the corporate set starts to fear what they can't control.

> Doc (Narration):

> You used to be a potential asset, Isaac. A resource under careful cultivation. What happens with these recruiters is they start seeing you as unpredictable. You become potentially somebody *else's* asset.

> Doc (Narration):

> They'll put you down a deep, dark hole, Isaac. CPC ***genpop***, maybe worse. You've only ever seen these cushy Juvenile Centers.

> Doc (Narration):

> I know you think I sold out the cause. That I went private-sector. But there is no ***cause***, there is only a loose grouping of like-minded anti-authoritarians, operating under a similar set of delusions about the nature of a far horizon and the responsibilities of man.

> Doc (Narration):

> But you aren't deluded are you, Isaac? Your psychosis runs much deeper. ***Obsession***. I can see it in your eyes.

\*Description\*

> Doc (Narration):

> In your mind, you aren't even here right now.

> Doc ( Narration):

> You're tripping out the light fantastic.

> Doc (Narration):

> Raising your hands to touch the skin of the World Bird.

> Doc (Narration):

> Isaac, I'm going to tell you something and I really need you to listen to me. Tune into this...

> Doc (Narration):

> We're out of time, here. I hope to see you again, Isaac. I really do.

Page 18 - Exterior - L15 Vineyard Estate
======

\*See Layer 15: Vineyard. Eamon Hall and the political figure Noah "Red"
Kelsey stand at a dock, at the foot of a ranch bordering a lake, there
is a thick thatch of green trees on one side of the lake, and 3/4ths of
the vista is filled with vineyards.\*

### 1st:

> INFO BOX: Layer 15: Vineyard

> Hall:

> The motorcade is on-layer. 15 minutes, Mr. Speaker.

> Noah:

> It's going to be one of those days, Hall. Can you just call me Noah? Red? I was barely speaker anyway, before the backbenchers smelled blood in the water.

\*Noah looking worse for wear, takes a sip of his canteen\*

> Hall:

> You told me, once, tell you when you were about to go out in public and you looked like shit. Now is that time.

> Noah:

> I know.

\*Takes a sip of his drink\*

### 2nd:

> Noah:

> I perk up under lights. Besides, this guy we're dealing with today is a real prick. So, to a certain extent, fuck him. He needs to learn the meaning of "Retirement".

\*Takes a sip of his drink\*

> Hall:

> From a security standpoint, the safest place in the Arcology is in the bar in your basement.

> Noah:

> No audience. Besides, I'm pretty sure I can make this guy cry. Here's a piece of free advice: in this business, you haven't landed your big speech unless you ended some hack necktie's career on 31, 28, or 21.

> Hall:

> Sounds like you might be the one smelling blood in the water.

> Noah:

> After 4 decades of watching these people both simultaneously piss on and defile, with the same giant cash-filled dick, the withered corpse of our republic, I'd say it's just blood mixing with blood.

> Noah:

> Don't quote that.

\*Noah takes a sip\*

> Noah:

> No, fuck it. Put that in a book. Make it the title.

\*Limo arrives. Noah gets in while avoiding creases in his fine suit
using his hands. Noah nods to others in the security team and we see the
motorcade rolling out from the ranch.\*

Page 19 - Interior - Limo
======

### 1st

\*Kyle is thin-boned, pretentious, and has a smarmy face. He is dressed
in a cool, angular suit. He has a black tablet (graphs/pie charts may
show) and papers with him. He is alone on the opposite side of a wide
expanse, in alpha male position taking up space with spread legs and
spread items.\*

> Kyle:

> Excuse my abruptness, Mr. Speaker, but I need to see the revisions. You address the joint-session in 15 minutes.

> Noah:

> That reminds me...

> Noah (speaking through intercom):

> Tim, can you take the long way. We need to kill half an hour.

> Intercom:

> ***No problem.***

### 2nd/3rd

> Kyle:

> So you're going to blow off the keynote address of the only Constitutional Convention in living memory just to polish up the language on your poorly argued ***jerimiad***, which I'm sure you had no choice but to purge from your alcohol-pickled soul.

> Noah:

> Relax. It's the keynote on the ***third night***. Viewership fell off a cliff yesterday; something about a media-strategy put together with a slack-eyed hillbilly-moonshiner's subtlety and grace.

> Noah:

> Besides, Dan Wu is doing the introduction. He can use the time at-bat. We want him to get extemporaneous on Senate Judiciary Reform.

> Kyle:

> That bill is dead. Read your talking points.

> Noah:

> It's only dead in committee. Technically, it's ***stalled***. Glaciers shift if you're willing to wait enough years.

> Kyle:

> Well I hope you take heart in the knowledge that a lot of us working in the Party are just praying for you to throw a clot and thrash out in a puddle of your own leavings, so we can finally start dismantling every one of your legislative and policy achievements.

> Noah:

> Yeah, welcome to politics.

> Noah:

> Get a suit that fits and they might let you sit at the grown up's table.

> You can't give that speech, in that form, from our stage. Period. End of discussion. Give me your hardcopy and I'll show you the edits we made.

\*Kyle grabs for the speech\*

\*Hall grabs his hand out of the air and turns his hand upside-down such that the elbow and shoulder twist uncomfortably\*

> Kyle:

> What the fuck!? Get your hands off me.

\*Kyle pulls back, visibly angry\*

> Noah:

> Allow me to introduce the head of my security detail: Eamon Hall.

> Kyle:

> Mr Hall, I'm Kyle Couiliby, Communications Director for the Delegate House Campaign Committee. You must be out of the I.S. pool. You should know I've stockpiled plenty of ***blat*** with your Commissioner . If you touch me again, you'll be humping a suicide parade through Slumline by Monday.

> Noah:

> You think I would trust my life with I.S.?

> Noah:

> ***Really***?

> Noah:

> Hall is ex-military, out of the 131st Special Grenadiers, awarded two Highest Honors Commendations and the Gold Citation. He was a personal hire.

> Noah:

> Military, eh? How many babies have you killed today?

> Hall:

> None so far.

> Kyle:

> So you consider yourself a dangerous person, Hall? Well I'm a dangerous person, too.

> Hall:

> Guy, I got to tell you: I've know you for about 5 minutes, and it's painfully clear to me that you have ***no clue*** who is and isn't dangerous.

\*Hall looks at Noah\*

\*Noah taps on the intercom\*

> Noah:

> Tim, here's good.

\*Kyle is forced out of the Limo, into the intersection.\*

> Noah:

> Alright Kyle, so this is where we part ways. You see the cameras I've arranged for.

\*Noah indicates photographer moving into place for pictures.\*

> Noah:

> There...

\*Noah indicates a photographer waiting on the side of the road.

> Noah:

> There, too.

\*Noah indicates another photographer, maybe in another direction.
Camera's click.

> Kyle:

> What is this? A photo sting. Congratulations, you caught me in a limousine. Sit down old man, before you get the piss-shivers and make an even further disgrace of yourself.

> Noah:

> We got to the girl, Kyle. A House staffer who suddenly feels less enthusiastic about your affair now that you've slow-walking plans for a divorce. It's funny how hostile a workplace can become, retroactively. I've been there, as I'm sure you know. Hell, the whole world does.

> Noah:

> We also have the DHCC expense-account irregularities, plus we can tie you to the Buy-Vote subsidy debacle.

> Noah:

> But we need a focal point for the press to hang the narrative around.

### Merge panel 1/2/3 Ice Fields Intersection

> Noah:

> Say, your ejection from this motorcade on charges of moral corruption and incompetence. You, called to account in the public square and on the people's record.

> Noah:

> But the editorials are already written. I've seen the drafts. But for the purposes of showmanship, let me give you a single piece of free advice...

> Noah:

> There's an old story about a dragon and a prostitute cursed to wait in the desert for the end of the world. The prostitute rides the dragon, but the dragon remains perfectly mealy paces.

> Noah:

> Your instincts are telling you that you're the dragon, Kyle. You have ***never*** been the dragon...

> Kyle:

> This is about Judiciary? Senators Chamblis and Horst, right? They've been trying to push me out this whole cycle.

> Noah:

> Yes.

> Kyle:

> And you got their votes?

> Noah:

> No. They're just going to lie to the whip, then vote against it if it ever makes the floor. That's how much your scalp is worth.

> Noah:

> Still, though: ***progress***.
