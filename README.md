# Arco

### Summary

*Arco* is an open-source inspired graphic novel heavily steeped in the cyberpunk ethos, set in a morally decayed but technologically impressive, mountain-scale archology.  When a prominent political figure is assassinated, his bodyguard Hall Eamon goes on a revenge rampage, with the help of an incarcerated hacker, King, and a dangerously brain-damaged A-List movie star, Jexa.


### Artist Recruit

The success of this project relies on attracting talented and committed artists to the project.  There is an open call for art submissions that either match the below style guide OR interpret the script / characters / setting in an undeniably superior way.  The intention is NOT to find artists willing to draw the graphic novel for free, but rather to establish a paid relationship that will scale over time.

To launch the art production side of this project, a budget of $2500 is available (from self-funding) to be split among anybody that can contribute to the successful completion of the first issue, as per [THE SCRIPT](..//master/issue-1/script.md).

Use the social links below to get in touch with questions, for more details about applying, or to submit work for consideration.  While portfolio work will be carefully considered, we need to see something from the *Arco* world. Quick sketches or rough work encouraged.
